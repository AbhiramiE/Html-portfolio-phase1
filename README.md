I have used various styling methods like inline, internal, external stylesheets. 
o Layout techniques Flexbox, Grid etc.. 
o Responsiveness like viewport, media query etc.. 
o also added a background animation video. 
Note: The projects displayed in the "Projects" section are not my own work. They have been taken 
from Google. 
• I have used HTML for structuring the website content and CSS for styling the website. 
* I have used internal and external css for some tags to show which will take its role when we try to apply both. With variety of css property I was able to make it more alive and flex, media query etc helped to make it more attractive and responsive.
* HTML helped me to structure my code.
