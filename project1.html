    <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on developing and implementing AI systems to enable vehicles to operate autonomously without human intervention.
     The goal is to create safe, efficient, and intelligent self-driving capabilities.</p>

    <h2>AI's Role</h2>
    <p>AI is the core intelligence driving self-driving cars, enabling them to perceive,
       understand, plan, and act in complex environments. Here's a breakdown of AI's key roles:</p>
    <div class="ai-role">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Perception of the Environment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Computer Vision (CNNs):</strong> AI algorithms analyze data from cameras to identify and classify objects.
                                Deep Learning models like CNNs learn intricate visual patterns from vast image and video datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensor Fusion:</strong> AI integrates data from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive and robust understanding of the surroundings, overcoming the limitations of individual sensors. </li>
                              
                    <li><strong>Object Detection and Tracking:</strong> AI algorithms identify the location and movement of objects in real-time,
                         predicting their future trajectories using techniques like Kalman filters and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Understanding and Decision-Making:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scene Understanding:</strong> AI builds a semantic understanding of the driving scene, interpreting the relationships between different objects and predicting potential interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Path Planning :</strong> AI algorithms plan the optimal route from the starting point to the destination and generate real-time trajectories to navigate obstacles and traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Planning:</strong> AI systems make high-level decisions about driving maneuvers based on the perceived environment and planned path,
                         often using state machines, rule-based systems, or Reinforcement Learning.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Control and Action:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL):</strong> AI agents can learn optimal control policies for driving in complex environments through trial and error, optimizing for safety and efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Predictive Control (MPC):</strong> AI-powered controllers predict the future behavior of the vehicle and optimize control inputs to follow the planned trajectory accurately and smoothly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
